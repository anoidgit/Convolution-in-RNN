# Convolution-in-RNN
Convolution Neural Network in RNN (GRU、LSTM、etc)

Most work based on the Element-Research/rnn (https://github.com/Element-Research/rnn), appreciate for their work ;-)

Modules API are almost same with Element-Research/rnn except add an argument at the last position where you could put your CNN here and it will be included and processed as a part of RNN.
